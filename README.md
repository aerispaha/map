# Reclaim Map

*Organizer and activist map developed by Reclaim Philadelphia*


## Summary
The Reclaim Map project intends to help citizens of Philadelphia build
grassroots political power by making it easy to understand their local
political environment. Our goal is to make an extremely intuitive web app
that makes it easy for users to see where political boundaries lie, who
represents them, and how to engage with local leaders. We think that people will
feel more empowered to engage in electoral campaigns and direct action when they
can see who represents them and their community at the local level.

will allow users to understand exactly what local leaders (from committeeperson
to U.S. representative) represent their community, how to contact them, and when
they are up for reelection.

While serving as a resource for experienced organizers, an important motivation for this tool is to lower the perceived threshold of entry into local politics and activism. The hope is that by providing Philadelphians with easy access to this information, more will become engaged, more will be inspired to hold their local representatives accountable, and more will consider challenging incumbents in future elections.

A prototype of the map is hosted [here](https://reclaimphiladelphia.github.io/reclaim_map/).
