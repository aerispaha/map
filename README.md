# Reclaim Map

*Organizer and activist map developed by Reclaim Philadelphia*


### Summary
A tool is proposed to help organizers in Philadelphia build capacity among their membership and inspire others to get involved by making it easy to understand and engage with their local political environment. The tool will allow users to understand exactly what local leaders (from committeeperson to U.S. representative) represent their community, how to contact them, and when they are up for reelection. While serving as a resource for experienced organizers, an important motivation for this tool is to lower the perceived threshold of entry into local politics and activism. The hope is that by providing Philadelphians with easy access to this information, more will become engaged, more will be inspired to hold their local representatives accountable, and more will consider challenging incumbents in future elections.

A prototype of the map is hosted [here](https://reclaimphiladelphia.github.io/reclaim_map/).
